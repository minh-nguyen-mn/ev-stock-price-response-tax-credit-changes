# Electric Vehicle Companies' Stock Price Response to Tax Credit Changes

This research paper investigates the impact of tax credit changes on electric vehicle (EV) sales and the stock prices of automobile companies with a stake in the EV market. The study focuses on the announcement and implementation of increased tax credit qualifications in the United States. The primary companies analyzed are Tesla, Rivian, Nissan, and Ford, which account for a significant portion of the U.S. EV market. The research explores two possible responses by EV market leaders to the tax credit changes: reducing prices or making changes in production to accommodate the tax credit. The hypothesis suggests that tighter restrictions on EV tax credits will result in a drop in stock prices for affected automobile companies. The study utilizes the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) to analyze the data. The results show fluctuations in abnormal returns around the announcement and implementation events, with Tesla and Rivian experiencing more significant negative impacts. The average CARs around the events are not statistically significant, but the downward trend in CARs supports the hypothesis. The research provides insights into the effects of EV tax credit changes on stock prices and highlights the varying impacts on different EV manufacturers.
